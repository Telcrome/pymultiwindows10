This simple script demonstrates how to set your mouse cursor to a specific location using the keyboard.

When using multiple screen it might happen that you lose your cursor, so I use it to place the cursor back in the middle of my main screen.
Simply bind a mouse button to a keyboard sequence and use this script to bind it to a mouse placement.
